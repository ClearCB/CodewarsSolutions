# Codewars_solutions (python)

This is a repository that will contain my solutions to the some exercises from codewars.

Codewars is a web page in which exist a lot of different kinds of exercises to solve with code. It is focused on solving alghoritms and learning from zero to hero to domain a language.

I used it to start learning basics of python and java.
